model-driven development since they impact on the design process reliability.
Ideally, model transformations should be designed and tested so that they may
be used and reused safely as MDA components. We present a method for building
trustable MDA components. We first define the notion of MDA component
as composed of its specification, one implementation and a set of associated test
cases. The testing-for-trust approach checks the consistency between these three
facets using the mutation analysis. It points out the lack of efficiency of the
tests and the lack of precision of the specification. The mutation analysis thus
gives a rate that evaluates: the level of consistency between the components
facets and the level of trust we can have in a component. Relying on this
estimation of the component trustability, developers can consciously trade
reliability for resources.},

    It refers to the process of modifying a (usually graphical) model for the purpose of analysis

    graph transformation. This framework offers visual and formal techniques based on rules,
    in such a way that model transformations can be subject to analysis. Previous results on
    graph transformation are extended by proving the termination of a transformation if the rules
    applied meet certain criteria. We show the suitability of the approach by an example in which
    we translate a simplified version of Statecharts into Petri nets for functional correctness
    analysis.},

abstract={With model transformations becoming more widely used, there is an increasing need for approaches focussing on a systematic development of model transformations. Although a number of approaches for specifying model transformations exist, none of them focusses on systematically validating model transformations with respect to termination and confluence. Termination and confluence ensure that a model transformation always produces a unique result. Also called functionality, these properties are important requirements for practical applicatons of model transformations. In this paper, we introduce our approach to model transformation. Using and extending results from the theory of graph transformation, we investigate termination and confluence properties of model transformations specified in our approach. We establish a set of criteria for termination and confluence to be checked at design time by static analysis of the transformation rules and the underlying metamodels. Moreover, the criteria are formulated in such a way that they require less experience with the theory of graph transformation. Our concepts are illustrated by a running example of a model tranformation from statecharts to the process algebra Communicating Sequential Processes.},

          abstract = {In this paper we describe an application of the theory of graph transformations to the practise of language design. In particular, we have defined the static and dynamic semantics of a small but realistic object-oriented language (called TAAL) by mapping the language constructs to graphs (the static semantics) and modelling their effect by graph transformation rules (the dynamic semantics). This gives rise to execution models for all TAAL-programs, which can be used as the basis for formal verification.
This work constitutes a first step towards a method for defining all aspects of software languages, besides their concrete syntax, in a consistent and rigorous manner. Such a method facilitates the integration of formal correctness in the software development trajectory.},
